In this example, we examine a paramount concept of object-oriented design called SOLID. Specifically, 
interface segregation and dependency inversion. SOILD gained exposure in Robert Martin's 2000 essay on "Design Principles and Design Patterns."
It was not until later that Michael Feathers began building on what we now know as SOILD. Its principles aid developers in implementing a more
maintainable, coherent, and flexible application.

The I in SOILD signifies interface segregation, which adduces dismantling larger interfaces into smaller ones.
In return, developers can concentrate only on those methods of concern. Dependency Inversion refers to decoupling an application's modules. 
Therefore instead of high-level modules depending on lower-level modules, both rely on abstraction.
